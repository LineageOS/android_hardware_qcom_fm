(A side note, this app seemed have been originally written to be touching UI elements on none main threads which could cause crashes/UI hangs. A long term solution is to replace all the Runnables with AsyncTasks)",

I probably still want to put enableRadioOnOffUI() right after updateStationInfotoUI(), instead of putting it after tuneRadio(), just to save a few lines of codes:)\n\nErica, How do you think?",
